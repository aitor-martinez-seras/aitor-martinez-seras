Hi, Iâ€™m @aitor-martinez-seras, PhD Student in the Deusto University. I'm currently developing my PhD under TECNALIA Research & Innovation, one of the greatest applied research center in Spain. My main interests are Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with focus in the Out-of-Distribution detection and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
